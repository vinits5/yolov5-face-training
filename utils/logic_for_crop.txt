1) 250 times
	
	1) scale = randomly select from [0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
	2) short_side = short side of original image
	3) w, h = short side * scale = 0.3 x short_side upto short_side
	4) l = 0 to (width - w)
	5) t = 0 to (height - h)
	6) roi = [l, t, l + w, h + t] # Always square
	7) IoF = (Area of intersection of pred bbox and gt bbox) / (Area of pred bbox)
	8) value [nx1] = [IoFs of bboxes and gts]
		>> lt [nx1x2], rb [nx1x2], area_i [nx1], area_a [nx1]
	9) flag = Boolean array which is true where IoF of bbox is 1
	10) If no True in flag array, then skip following steps
	11) Select those bboxes, landms, where center of original bboxes is inside new RoIs
	12) If no such bbox found then continue
	13) !!! BBox and Landmarks !!!
			are being limited to the RoI of crop
			due to which the gt always remains inside RoI
			and the model might not get correct gt for cropped faces
		!!! 
	14) Check if any face is greater than 0x0 pixels, if not then continue
	15) Return if any found
